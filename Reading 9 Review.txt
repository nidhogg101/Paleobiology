1) Article Summary
Mass extinctions are an important topic of study, both in paleobiology and in the more general context of community
ecology. The loss of taxonomic diversity is a favorite method for evaluating the severity of mass extinctions, but 
this study questions whether this is an appropriate quantification of the ecological consequences of extinction.
To answer the question, the authors look at two similar mass extinctions: the Late Ordovician and the Late 
Devonian. They evaluate the severity of these mass extinctions using a graduated structure of scales of change.
At the first and most severe level, entire ecosystems emerge or disappear; at the fourth and least intense level,
communities arise or disappear, or minor taxonomic changes occur within groups. This analysis found that, while
the Late Ordovician and Late Devonian mass extinctions were very similar in respect to taxonomic losses, the 
ecological impacts of those losses differed greatly. Taxa that suffered huge losses during the Late Ordovician
extinction managed to recover quickly, and the Silurian was characterized by much the same ecological relationships
as the Ordovician before it. The Late Devonian extinction, on the other hand, triggered second-level ecological
changes in additionto the third- and fourth- level changes observed for the Late Ordovician extinction. The
conclusion of this study is that different taxa have different ecological impacts when they go extinct. For example,
dominant taxa like forest trees or corals affect ecosystems because of their high biomass. Keystone species,
on the other hand, have lower biomass but disproportionate ecological impact. These conclusions emphasize the need
for a modern conservation strategy that prioritizes taxa with high ecological impact.   


2) Things you liked about the paper
This paper places a reduced emphasis on quantitative analyses. This leads to a shorter paper with a more direct 
argument: instead of data-calculations-results-interpretation, research can focus on a shorter data-interpretation
path. On one hand, this is somewhat refreshing because some scientifically significant concepts are difficult to 
quantify. 


3) Things you didn't like about the paper
On the other hand, the reduced use of quantitative data does have drawbacks; one of the more obvious is that the
findings are harder to disprove and validate. Another drawback is that it is harder to apply this technique to 
different systems. There's a reason science almost always demands rigorous quantified data. 

4) Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any) 
This article has one rather strange figure, a line-environment diagram for environmental and temporal distribution
of Paleozoic and Cambrian fauna. I don't like this one at all. It may have been clearer if it were turned clockwise,
or split into two separate figures.
