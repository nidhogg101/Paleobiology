largeribs,mediumribs: 0 (no statistically discernible difference in shape at  all)
tinysmooth,tinyribs: 3 (no significant difference in shape)


1. I recognize four species:
"tiny":5,14,23,24,2,6,12,18
"mediumsmooth":3,7,13,15,16,17,22
"largesmooth":9,10,19,25
"largeribs":1,8,11,4,20,21,
Originally, there were six. Shape-based calculations suggested that "tinysmooth" and "tinyribs" were 
likely the same species, and that "mediumribs" were probably juveniles or females of "largeribs"

2. The distinctions are based on three rough size classes; "tiny","medium", and "large",
 ,the presence of ridges on the shell, and some comparisons of shape (umbilical width to diameter).  

3. It is probable that some of the other "tiny" specimens are still in fact juvenile individuals of larger species. 
However, this is difficult to confirm using only simple morphological clues. 

4. Likewise, it is possible that smaller "species" are in fact females of larger species. Because 
sexual dimorphism in ammonites usually isn't discernible before adulthood, and because determining which
individuals are adults and which are juveniles is difficult, identifying specimens as female (or adult, for
that matter) continues to be an exercise in guesswork.

Part 2 Questions Subsection 2
1. > names(hummingbirds)
[1] "land"     "curvepts"

2.  ProcrustesHummingbirds<-gpagen(hummingbirds[["land"]])

3. plotTangentSpace(ProcrustesHummingbirds[["coords"]],warpgrids=FALSE,verbose=FALSE)

4. It's difficult to say how many species are here. 
I theorize that there are two species, with substantial outliers.
